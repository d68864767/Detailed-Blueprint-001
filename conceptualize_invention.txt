Title: [Your Invention's Name]

1. Originality:
Describe how your invention is unique and not an obvious modification of existing technology. Explain the innovative aspects that differentiate it from existing solutions.

2. Functionality:
Describe the specific problem your invention is solving. Explain how it works and why it is an effective solution to this problem.

Remember, this is a conceptual document. It should be detailed enough to give a clear understanding of your invention, but it doesn't need to include technical specifications or blueprints - those will come later in the process.
